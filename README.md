## Introduction 

Unexpected changes (e.g., deviant stimuli) in
a repetitive stream of standard stimuli are known to prolong responses
in visual categorization tasks [e.g., @Parmentier2014rev] and disrupt
short-term memory [e.g., @Hughes2007]. While this deviation effect has
been studied extensively using sounds, far less focus has been on
unexpected changes in irrelevant bimodal stimuli. A further issue is
whether a spatial change in either the tactile, auditory or in both
modalities simultaneously, affects verbal and spatial short-term memory
similarly.

## Aim

Examine whether the short-term memory (STM) is
domain-specific by using deviant spatial changes in bimodal (auditory
and vibrotactile) and uni-modal (vibrotactile) to-be-ignored (TBI)
sequences.


## Methods 
Across two experiments subjects performed (47 and 50, in Experiment 1 and 2, respectively) verbal and spatial STM tasks while being exposed to TBI sequences.\

In the verbal task, 7 digits were taken randomly without replacement
from the digit set 1-9. In the spatial task, 7 items (dots) were taken
randomly from a 5 x 5 matrix.\
The vibrotactile sequences were comprised of 10 repetitions of a
vibration of 240Hz, and the amplitude of 1.8g (peak-to-peak), delivered
using coin vibration motors. The auditory sequences were comprised of 10
repetitions of a 600Hz tone, delivered through sound attenuated
headphones. See Figure 1 for a schematic overview of the experiments.\
In Experiment 1, TBI sequence consisted of both auditory and
vibrotactile sequences (simultaneously presented) whereas only
vibrations were used in Experiment 2. The TBI sequences changed side of
the body on 20% of the trials (spatial deviant trials). The task was to
remember the order of the TBR items.

## Results & Discussion
The proportion of correctly recalled items was analyzed using a 2 (Task: Spatial, Verbal) x 2 (Trialtype:
Standard, Deviant).

*Experiment 1.* Subjects performance were significantly worse in the
spatial task. Performance in the spatial deviant trials was worse
compared to standard trials (See Table 1).

To further examine the impact of the spatial deviant, one-way ANOVAs for
each tasks were conducted. It revealed that the spatial deviant affected
both tasks negatively (see Figure 1), meaning that a spatial change can
distract both spatial and verbal STM.

*Experiment 2.* Performance was significantly worse in the spatial task
but there was no evidence that the spatial change (i.e., spatial
deviant) in the vibrotactile TBI sequence affected performance. See
Table 2.


##Conclusions

-   An unexpected spatial change in a bimodal TBI sequence affects both
    verbal and spatial short-term memory whereas a spatial change in a
    vibrotactile TBI sequence does not.

-   Our results from Experiment 1 (see also @Vachon2016) questions the
    assumption of domain-specificity but is in line with Cowan’s model
    (e.g., 1995) and multisensory perspectives [e.g., @Quak2015].

-   However, our results from Experiment 2 may be troublesome for
    multisensory perspectives of STM/WM.
